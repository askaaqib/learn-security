# Learn _`IT Security & Privacy`_ [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security/issues)


Security, Privacy and Data Protection in information technology
systems is **NOT** "_**Optional**_". <br />
And yet, _most_ people prefer to _ignore_ the subject ...

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21071387/95ef3cc4-be96-11e6-83b6-1ae4c9009cb3.png)

resorting to "[_ignorance is bliss_](https://youtu.be/l5y68ErffgM)"
_convincing_ themselves that the problem will somehow go away.

## _Why_?

For _most_ (_small/medium_) **organizations** (_and **many** large ones!_) technology project(s) **security**
is an "[***afterthought***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/afterthought#Noun)", <br />
which people only _consider_ when they
_have_ to; _usually when the "**unthinkable**" (data compromise) happens_...

The loss of people's data can be [_devastating_](http://www.today.com/money/id-theft-can-take-heavy-emotional-toll-victims-1D80305639)
_both_ on a personal and organizational level.  <br />
Why _not_ take a few simple steps to _prevent_ it...?


## _Who_?

_Everyone_ in your organization _**must**_ have a _**security mindset**_! <br />

![security-fail-cable-tie-chain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21071637/a8ee1798-be9e-11e6-98b3-e08b3d4ad6ac.jpg)

_Preferably **everyone** in all the organizations you **work/associate
with** will have be **security-educated**, <br />
because sadly, (naive/well-meaning) **people** remain the "[**weakest link**](http://www.cio.com/article/2895404/cybercrime/people-remain-the-weakest-link-in-security.html)"_.


## _What_?

> Firstly we must come to terms with the fact that it's **impossible to be 100% secure** because there will
_always_ be "_uncertainty_". That does not mean we should "_give up_"

There are _many_ areas of IT security that people in your team(s)
need to be aware of, they include:

+ Malware: https://youtu.be/cKlRc1_f5NY
+ Phishing: https://youtu.be/WpaLmeHTp3I
+ WiFi Safety: https://youtu.be/T5HCy3udooo

## How?

![magic-pill](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21573069/440ea2d0-ced8-11e6-9dca-537e5dab857f.jpg)

Sadly there is no "***magic pill***" we can take to make _everything_ secure. <br />
Thankfully, there are _several_ simple principles/practices we can follow that will help!

### Be Paranoid

Be paranoid about security. <br />
(_Sadly_) Personal data is ["**_Big_ Business**"](http://europe.newsweek.com/secretive-world-selling-data-about-you-464789) <br />
(_Unscrupulous_) people/organizations _are_ (_actively_) trying to ["_acquire_"](https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/30/facebook-buys-data-on-users-offline-habits-for-better-ads/) your data. <br />
"_Nasty_" people are _constantly_ running scripts, trying to ["_crack_" websites](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day-how-do-you-host-yours). <br />
If you _hope_ to be successful, you should _expect_ your website/application to
be "_probed_" by somebody somewhere.
Don't _wait_ till the _breach_ happens. Plan ahead and be paranoid!

### Principle of _Least Privilege_

> "_Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate
using the **least** amount of **privilege necessary** to complete the job_."

The level of access granted to a person/user or program/script should be
only that necessary for its legitimate purpose. The simple rule of thumb is:
if the person/program only needs read-access don't give it write access.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

### Never Share User Accounts/Passwords

If you have an account on a system (_e.g: GitHub or AWS_)
maintain _accountability_ for yourself an others by _never_ sharing your account
or password with others.

> **Note**: this is not a question of "_trusting_" the people in your life/work!
We trust drivers with our lives each time we get into a vehicle with them,
but not all trust is the same. <br />
_Most_ non-technical people do not have good "_security habits_". <br />
**e.g**: _some_ people click on _any_ (_every_) link sent to them by "Facebook".
_Most_ people cannot distinguish a "_real_" email from "Facebook" from a
a fake (_phishing_) email. These people are _trivial_ to socially engineer.
Despite our _multiple_ attempts to "_educate_" these people,
unless they have "_felt the pain_" of identity fraud, for example,
they are unlikely to see the _benefit_ of being _careful_ online.

I know this might sound "dramatic" but if I can impress the _seriousness_ of this
upon you, in a _memorable_ way I will do so: <br />

#### ... think about sharing your _account/password_ like sharing a _needle_!

![djs-dont-share-needles](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21574204/d9c1ae0e-cee6-11e6-8e45-9f686697cfe2.png)


> **Note**: this is why systems that charge per user-account per month are to be avoided <br />
because they _perversely_ incentivize people to
share account in order to avoid paying <br />
for more "users", "seats" or "licenses". Salesforce/Atlassian/Microsoft we're looking at you!!

### Use Encryption!

![encryption](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21574006/757862e2-cee3-11e6-8a84-6b1ab67c467f.jpeg)

Encrypting data which does not need to be full-text searchable is _generally_ a good idea. <br />
Encrypting any/all personally identifiable data required by your application is _essential_.

### OWASP Top 10

The **O**pen **W**eb **A**pplication **S**ecurity **P**roject (OWASP)
is a great source of information <br/>
about the most common _vulnerabilities_ in web applications/sites. <br />
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP

Rather than _repeat_ the OWASP "Top 10" _here_ we _encourage_ you to
view the list and _learn_ how each vulnerability on the list can be _mitigated_.

## Security Standards

### ISO 27001 ?

If you are interested in the ISO 27001 Information Technology Security standard, <br />
please see: https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security

### GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the new EU data protection
framework that will take over from the UK Data Protection Act 1998 as of
25th May 2018, for any organisations operating in or offering goods/services to
individuals in the EU.

> [For the UK] The government has confirmed that the UK’s decision to leave the EU will not affect the commencement of the GDPR.

We have read through these and pulled out information _relevant to the kind of
work that we do at dwyl_ and focus mostly on changes from DPA,
but please see the [Recommended Reading](#recommended-reading)
section below for resources with further details which may pertain to you and
are not included here.

#### Key Points
+ You must have a **lawful basis** to process personal data
  + The most common one here might be ` 6(1)(a) – Consent of the data subject`,
  but a list can be found at https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/key-areas-to-consider
+ **Consent**
  + Must be **opt-in** ("consent cannot be inferred from silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity")
  + Must be _separate_ from other Terms & Conditions
  + Must provide simple ways for consent to be withdrawn
  + No need to seek new consent from existing users _but_ "if you rely on
  individuals’ consent to process their data, make sure it will meet the GDPR
  standard on being specific, granular, clear, prominent, opt-in, properly
  documented and easily withdrawn"
+ For services offered _directly_ to children, additional measures of protection
for children's personal data will be put in place (see 'Children's Personal Data'
section on this page: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/key-areas-to-consider)
+ ***Actions*** around **individuals' rights**; individuals must:
  + _Be informed_ of [a number of things](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/individuals-rights/the-right-to-be-informed/)
  upon provision of their information (either by them or by a 3rd party)
  such as the legitimate interests of the party collecting the data and the  individual's right to withdraw consent at any time
  + _Have [access](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/individuals-rights/the-right-of-access/)_
  to their personal data and how it is being processed **for free**, within one month of requesting it
  + _Have the 'right to be forgotten'_ and completely [erased](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/individuals-rights/the-right-to-erasure/) from the system
  + _Have access to their data in a 'portable' form_ , i.e a [machine readable form](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/individuals-rights/the-right-to-data-portability/)
  such as CSV, within one month of the individual's request for the data
+ [Explicit accountability and transparency](https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security/blob/master/information-security-policy.md) policies & procedures
are now required (this was implicit in DPA), such as https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security/blob/master/information-security-policy.md
  + A good start for this is to have a code of conduct (see ['What will codes of conduct address?' section](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/) for more information)
+ Personal data _must_ be **stored inside the EU** (except in [exceptional circumstances](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/transfer-of-data/))
+ Data _processors_ will now also be held liable for compliance, not just the data
controllers (who decide what and why personal data is processed)
+ [Privacy Impact Assessments](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1595/pia-code-of-practice.pdf) are now mandatory for _certain high risk_ situations (this is still
  evolving as of the time of writing)

Fines for breaches and non-compliance are _considerably heftier_ than under DPA
and remember, both [data controllers _and_ data processors](https://www.iabuk.net/policy/briefings/iab-uk-gdpr-checklist#data)
are now liable under GDPR.
